	abstract = {In this work, the applicability and performance of a linear scaling algorithm is investigated for three-dimensional condensed phase systems. A simple but robust approach based on the matrix sign function is employed together with a thresholding matrix multiplication that does not require a prescribed sparsity pattern. Semiempirical methods and density functional theory have been tested. We demonstrate that self-consistent calculations with 1 million atoms are feasible for simple systems. With this approach, the computational cost of the calculation depends strongly on basis set quality. In the current implementation, high quality calculations for dense systems are limited to a few hundred thousand atoms. We report on the sparsities of the involved matrices as obtained at convergence and for intermediate iterations. We investigate how determining the chemical potential impacts the computational cost for very large systems.},

	abstract = {CP2K is an open source electronic structure and molecular dynamics software package to perform atomistic simulations of solid-state, liquid, molecular, and biological systems. It is especially aimed at massively parallel and linear-scaling electronic structure methods and state-of-theart ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Excellent performance for electronic structure calculations is achieved using novel algorithms implemented for modern high-performance computing systems. This review revisits the main capabilities of CP2K to perform efficient and accurate electronic structure simulations. The emphasis is put on density functional theory and multiple post–Hartree–Fock methods using the Gaussian and plane wave approach and its augmented all-electron extension.},

	abstract = {We present the Gaussian and plane waves (GPW) method and its implementation in QUICKSTEP which is part of the freely available program package CP2K. The GPW method allows for accurate density functional calculations in gas and condensed phases and can be effectively used for molecular dynamics simulations. We show how derivatives of the GPW energy functional, namely ionic forces and the Kohn–Sham matrix, can be computed in a consistent way. The computational cost of computing the total energy and the Kohn–Sham matrix is scaling linearly with the system size, even for condensed phase systems of just a few tens of atoms. The efﬁciency of the method allows for the use of large Gaussian basis sets for systems up to 3000 atoms, and we illustrate the accuracy of the method for various basis sets in gas and condensed phases. Agreement with basis set free calculations for single molecules and plane wave based calculations in the condensed phase is excellent. Wave function optimisation with the orbital transformation technique leads to good parallel performance, and outperforms traditional diagonalisation methods. Energy conserving Born–Oppenheimer dynamics can be performed, and a highly efﬁcient scheme is obtained using an extrapolation of the density matrix. We illustrate these ﬁndings with calculations using commodity PCs as well as supercomputers.},

	abstract = {The calculation of Hartree-Fock exchange (HFX) is computationally demanding for large systems described with high-quality basis sets. In this work, we show that excellent performance and good accuracy can nevertheless be obtained if an auxiliary density matrix is employed for the HFX calculation. Several schemes to derive an auxiliary density matrix from a high-quality density matrix are discussed. Key to the accuracy of the auxiliary density matrix methods (ADMM) is the use of a correction based on standard generalized gradient approximations for HFX. ADMM integrates seamlessly in existing HFX codes and, in particular, can be employed in linear scaling implementations. Demonstrating the performance of the method, the effect of HFX on the structure of liquid water is investigated in detail using Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics simulations (300 ps) of a system of 64 molecules. Representative for large systems are calculations on a solvated protein (Rubredoxin), for which ADMM outperforms the corresponding standard HFX implementation by approximately a factor 20.},
