# Water-AIMD-Examples
Example inputs for various DFT softwares on how to do ab initio molecular dynamics simulations of liquid water.

Simulations should be designed to run a geometry optimization followed by a short AIMD simulation.

In addition to input files, each directory should make an effort to include relevant references and slides explaining basic input structure.
